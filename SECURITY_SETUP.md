# üîí Security Setup Guide

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Immediate Actions Required

If you're setting up this application for the first time or if credentials were previously exposed, follow these steps immediately:

### 1. Database Credentials (CRITICAL)

**If database credentials were exposed, IMMEDIATELY rotate them:**

1. Login to your database hosting provider (premium12.web-hosting.com)
2. Change the password for user `rajvardhan_nscu`
3. Update the `backend/.env` file with new credentials:
   ```bash
   DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:NEW_PASSWORD@host:5432/database
   ```

### 2. SMTP Credentials (CRITICAL)

**If SMTP credentials were exposed (`ncore@nscu.govt.ac`), IMMEDIATELY:**

1. Change the email password at your email provider
2. Configure new SMTP settings in the admin dashboard (do NOT hardcode them)
3. Use the Admin Panel ‚Üí Email Settings to configure securely

### 3. JWT Secret (CRITICAL)

**Generate a secure JWT secret:**

```bash
# Generate a secure 32-byte random string
node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"
```

Add to `backend/.env`:
```
JWT_SECRET=<your-generated-secret-here>
```

### 4. Environment Files

**Never commit these files to git:**

- `backend/.env`
- `.env` (if you create one)

**Verify .gitignore includes:**
```
backend/.env
.env
*.env.local
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Features Implemented

### ‚úÖ Privilege Escalation Prevention
- Admin functions (`is_admin()`, `is_superadmin()`) now check `user_roles` table only
- Users cannot modify their own roles
- Trigger prevents role self-modification

### ‚úÖ Credential Protection
- No hardcoded database credentials
- No hardcoded SMTP passwords
- No hardcoded JWT secrets
- All secrets in environment variables

### ‚úÖ Edge Function Security
- `admin-update-password` checks `user_roles` table
- Proper admin verification before password updates

### ‚úÖ Authentication
- AuthContext uses `user_roles` as single source of truth
- No fallback to `profiles.role`
- Reduced console logging of sensitive data

## üìã Security Checklist for Production

Before deploying to production:

- [ ] All database passwords rotated if previously exposed
- [ ] All SMTP passwords rotated if previously exposed
- [ ] JWT secret generated and set in environment variable
- [ ] `backend/.env` file created with all required secrets
- [ ] `.gitignore` updated to exclude all `.env` files
- [ ] Git history cleaned if secrets were committed (use git-filter-repo)
- [ ] All console.log statements removed from production code
- [ ] Input validation added to all forms (Zod schemas)
- [ ] Rate limiting enabled on authentication
- [ ] RLS policies verified on all tables
- [ ] All users have roles in `user_roles` table
- [ ] MFA enabled in Supabase Auth settings
- [ ] Database backup configured
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting set up

## üîê User Roles Architecture

**IMPORTANT:** Roles MUST be stored in the `user_roles` table, NOT in the `profiles` table.

```sql
-- Correct way to check admin status
SELECT EXISTS (
  SELECT 1 FROM user_roles 
  WHERE user_id = auth.uid() 
  AND role = 'superadmin'
);

-- WRONG - DO NOT USE
SELECT role FROM profiles WHERE user_id = auth.uid();
```

### Why?

- `profiles.role` can potentially be modified by users
- `user_roles` table has strict RLS policies
- Security functions check `user_roles` only
- This prevents privilege escalation attacks

## üìù Environment Variables Reference

### Backend (.env)
```bash
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@host:port/db
JWT_SECRET=<32-byte-random-hex>
PORT=3001
CORS_ORIGIN=http://localhost:5173
```

### Supabase Secrets (via Dashboard)
- `CPANEL_API_TOKEN` - For email account management
- `CPANEL_HOST` - cPanel hostname
- `CPANEL_USERNAME` - cPanel username
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` - For AI features
- (Add others as needed)

## üö® Incident Response

If you suspect a security breach:

1. **Immediately rotate all credentials**
2. **Revoke all active sessions:** Run in Supabase SQL editor:
   ```sql
   -- This will force all users to re-login
   UPDATE auth.users SET updated_at = NOW();
   ```
3. **Check audit logs** for suspicious activity
4. **Review RLS policies** for any gaps
5. **Scan application logs** for unauthorized access attempts
6. **Document the incident** and timeline
7. **Notify affected users** if personal data was accessed
