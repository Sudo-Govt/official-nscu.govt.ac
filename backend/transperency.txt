Global Governance and Compliance Alignment

GCHEA Global Compliance Framework

The Global Council for Higher Education Accreditation (GCHEA) establishes international standards of academic integrity, institutional transparency, and governance compliance designed to uphold the credibility of higher education across borders.

GCHEA does not supersede or replace any national regulatory authority. Instead, it acts as a harmonizing framework — drawing upon the best legal, ethical, and procedural practices from recognized education councils, ministries, and accreditation agencies worldwide.

By aligning its model with the spirit of global cooperation, GCHEA ensures that no nation’s education system is overshadowed or undermined, but rather strengthened through shared accountability and transparency.

NSCU’s Commitment under the GCHEA Framework

New States Continental University voluntarily aligns with the GCHEA Global Compliance Charter, which consolidates best practices derived from:


CHEA and Middle States Commission (USA) – accreditation integrity & quality assurance

QAA (United Kingdom) – academic standards and program validation

UNESCO ISCED Framework (Global) – international comparability of qualifications

UGC Act (India) – governance transparency & institutional accountability

Bologna Process & European Standards for Quality Assurance (ESG) – harmonization of higher education structures


Through this alignment, NSCU ensures that every academic and administrative function meets or exceeds globally recognized compliance norms — including record maintenance, financial accountability, academic fairness, research integrity, and digital transparency.

Our Compliance Philosophy

> “We follow the law — even when it isn’t watching us.”

NSCU’s governance model embraces transparency as a living practice, not a regulatory requirement. Our systems of reporting, disclosure, and audit are rooted in ethical integrity, public accountability, and respect for every national education framework.
